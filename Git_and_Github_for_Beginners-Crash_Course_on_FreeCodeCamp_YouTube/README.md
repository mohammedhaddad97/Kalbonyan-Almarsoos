# Git and Github for Beginners - Crash Course ([YouTube: FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk))

## Why did I take this crash course even though there's a course on Git & Github in the [Programming Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-programmer-foundations) Path on LinkedIn??

The reason why is that I'm required to upload all my work through out this internship on Github and the ***Git & Github*** course is number 10 on the list so I would have to save the work of the first 10 courses on my local machine and then upload them on **Github** when I take the ***Git & Github*** course on LinkedIn.

I do know a little about Github and how to upload projects *BUT* it's not enough knowledge to work efficiently, so I decided to take a quick explanation on ***YouTube*** due to how to use **Github**.

I was looking for a 15 or 20 minute video but when I came across this [FreeCodeCamp YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) course I decided to take it as it will give me a better and wider understanding of ***Git & Github*** and how to use them. Now, without any further ado let's get into the course.

## What is git?
Git is a free and open Version Control and it's the most widly used Version Control Tool.

## Now, what is Version Control?
Version Control is a way for programmers to save and track their *code* changes, and have all previous version available to look at at any time.

### Beniftis of using Version Control:
- Helps to know what's been done.
- When was it done.
- Go back to a previous version of the code whenever we want to.


## Terms Used In The Course
**Directory** -> *Folder*

**Terminal or Command Line** -> *Interface for Text Commands*

**CLI** -> *Stands for **Command Line Interface***

**cd** -> *Change Directory

**Code Editor** -> *A program used to write and run code*

**Repository** -> *Mostly, refers to Git Repository. And it basically means; a folder containing your project*

**Github** -> *it's not **Git** because people sometimes confuse them together. **Git** is the way/tool you use to track and manage your work, **Github** is a website to host your git repositories online so you can share them with other people.*

## Git Commands you're gonna see in this course.

> **clone** -> *To download a repository from an online hose like **Github** on your Local Machine.*

> **add** -> *To notify **Git** that you've made some changes so it can keep track of those now changes.*

> **commit** -> *To save those new changes.*

> **push** -> *To uplaod those committed changes to a remote repository like **Github**, **BitBucket**, or **GitLab**.*

> **pull** -> *The opposite of **push**, **pull**; lets you download changes onto your Local Machine.*

### A story to remember

*Let's **clone** that repo to **add** some changes to it and **commit** them. then, we **push** the repo back again. But after a while we're gonna **pull** it back to repeat this cycle again.*

## Github
In this section of the course the instructor moved to talking a bit about **Github**; 
> *How to make an account?*

<br>

> *How to create a repository?*

<br>

> *How to add files to that repository, like the **README.md** file?*

<br>

> *How to **edit** and **commit** that file?*

<br>

> *How to see all the **commits** that's ever been made?*.

<br>

*And I don't think I need to write down all those steps because it's pretty easy and not worth taking the time.*

## Using *Git* in Local Machine.

### And here we have two ways:
1. clone a repo that already exists on Github.
2. A repo that's on our local machine and we want to push to Github.

## First, cloning a Github repo.
Let's see how we can:
- clone a Github repo.
- make changes to that repo.
- add those changes to git.
- commit those changes.
- Then, making those changes live on Github by pushing them to Github.

### Here's a link to a video on YouTube showing you exactly how to do so. [video](https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk?t=423) upto second: **26:29**

#### **NOTE:** 
if
```
git push origin master
```
returned an error, try using this.
```
git push origin main
```

## Second, a repo that's on your machine and you wanna add to Github.
