## Questions

### With if-else statements, we will always execute one of the code blocks depending on the result of the condition test.

- [ ] FALSE
- [x] TRUE

### Which operator will you use to return true if two variables are different?

- [ ] ```>=```

- [ ] ```=```

- [ ] ```>```
- [x] ```!=```

### Which if-else statement will not produce this output?
```is divisible by 3```

```python
num = 36
 if num % 3 == 0:
  print("is divisible by 3")
 else:
  print("is not divisible by 3")
```
```python
num = 16
 if num % 3 == 0:
  print("is divisible by 3")
 else:
  print("is not divisible by 3")
```
```python
num = 15
 if num % 3 == 0:
  print("is divisible by 3")
 else:
  print("is not divisible by 3")
```

> The second choice is the correct answer

### Any expression that breaks down to either true or false is called a conditional, or ```_____```.


- [x] boolean expression
- [ ] string expression
- [ ] truthy expression

### This if-else statement is written in ```_____```.
```
if "apples" == "apples"
  puts "You're comparing the same thing"
 end
```

- [ ] Java
- [ ] Python
- [x] Ruby

### Which of these is not a relational operator?

- [x] ```=```
- [ ] ```>```
- [ ] ```!=```
- [ ] ```>=```

### What is the issue with the following code?
```
number = input("Enter a number: ")
 if number == 10:
  print("The number is greater than 10.")
 else:
  print("The number is less than 10.") 
```


- [ ] The input statement cannot accept numbers.
- [ ] The print statements are not indented correctly.
- [ ] The if-else syntax is incorrect.
- [x] The conditional statement is checking for equality.

> I couldn't choose the correct answer for this question but my problem was with the messed up indentation.

### What is the output of this program?
```
num = 16
 if num % 3 == 0:
  print(num, "is divisible by 3")
 print("The end")
```

- [ ] ```16 is divisible by 3```
- [ ] ```16 is divisible by 3 The end```
- [x] ```The end```

### Multiple statements grouped together are called a ```_____```.

- [ ] cluster
- [x] block
- [ ] grouping

### Which code can you use to print if a test score is a pass or a fail?

```
if (score>=60) print("passed")
 else print("failed")
```

```
if (score>=60):
  print("passed")
 else:
  print("failed")
```

```
if (score>=60):
 print("passed")
 else:
 print("failed")
```

```
if (score>=60):
  print("passed") else
  print("failed"
```

> The second choice is the correct answer.

### What will the following condition print?
```
if (num>=0):
  print(num)
 else:
  print(-1 * num)
```

- [ ] the value of ```num```
- [ ] the value of ```num``` minus 1
- [ ] an indication if ```num``` is negative
- [x] the absolute value of ```num```

### What is the output of the following program?
```
number = 10
 if number % 4 == 0:
  print(number, "is divisible by 4")
 print("All done")
```

- [ ] ```10 is divisible by 4```

- [ ] The program will error out.

- [ ] ```10 is divisible by 4 All done```
- [x] ```All done```
