# Kalbonyan Al-Marsoos Training, Hello World!

**In this repository I'm going to document my journey as an intern at [Kalbonyan Almarsoos](https://www.linkedin.com/company/%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B5/)**

## A bit about my programming background.

Before digging into the details of the training I'd love to briefly talk about my programming history.

The first time I decided to learn Programming was in **2016** I know, ages ago. Nothign fancy so far, in the same year I enrolled into university and my major was **Computer Science** how lucky, right?! Well, that didn't go very well and I had to shift major.

The first programming langauge I ever learned was ```C++``` and that was at university, learned the basics of programming and did a fair amount of problem sovling.

I was very passionate and hungry to dig as deep as I can into the field and learn as much as I possibly can but that energy was *unguided* and that's very unfortunate because I wasted a lot of time and energy hoping from ```Web Dev``` to ```Cyber Security``` to ```Machine Learning``` and from ```C++``` to ```Pythong```, then to ```Java``` and the total knowledge or outcome of that all was almost *nothing*, I didn't dive deep into any of 'em *but* one good thing is that I did learn the **basics of programming** and digested it very well Alhamdulillah.

Then very recently, after studying the book ```Head First Java``` I started learning ```Spring Boot``` and while doing so I came across this training and here's another turning point.

## Why repeating the same mistake again by joining Kalbonyan Al-Marsoos?

It might be just another one of my endless expidations that eventually leads to nothing except my undying perseverance to becoming a **Programmer** but for some reason I have a good feeling about this.

### Alright now, **WHY?**

1. One of the main reasons as to why I joined Kalbonyan Al-Marsoos is how **precise** the curriculum is.
2. Being part of a pack, this helps so much to keep going especially when you feel like giving up, they pull you up.
3. Knowing where will I start, How I'll go, where will I be, and what would I do along the way, this allows you to kinda assess yourself and track your progress and this itself helps you to also keep going.
